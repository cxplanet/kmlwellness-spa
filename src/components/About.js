            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <h2>Finding Inspiration in Every Turn</h2>
            <p>Through my fifties, I considered myself to be a healthy, fit individual. I didnâ€™t have any chronic conditions (though parents and grands did). I had no allergies, I exercised regularly and I slept well. With the exception of semi-annual PCP and OB/GYN visits, I rarely found myself in need of a doctor. In my early 50s I was diagnosed with Osteopenia and 5 years later with Osteoporosis. When I began peri-menopause, my GYN asked if I wanted HRT, but since my mom had been through a bout of post-menopause breast cancer, I opted out.
            Through self study and working with a Functional Medicine doctor, I have come to learn the importance of bio-identical HRT. I have become focused on improving my bone density with a combination of yoga, HIIT and weight lifting. I have also improved my incontinence with a regular pelvic floor strengthening routine. I have learned the importance of keeping my hormones inn balance and have started HRT.</p>
            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <div className="aboutList">
            <ul>
            <li>I want to save other women the uncertainty of deciding to opt in or out of HRT.</li>
            <li>I want to help them stay strong and upright for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I want to help them improve their sleep, reduce their stress and make the lifestyle changes they want to do achieve these goals.</li>
            <li>I want to help them balance their hormones and find balance in their lives,</li>
