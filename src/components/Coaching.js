            <h1>Coaching for Menopause</h1>
            <p>Navigating the journey of menopause can be challenging. There are so many potential symptoms and every woman experiences this time of life differently. Sometimes you don’t even recognize the person these symptoms have created! Hot flashes, night sweats, poor sleep, the inability to lose weight and increased belly fat even though you’re working out as hard as you ever have, stress, brain fog, and fatigue to name just a few. And then there are the consequences of hormonal imbalance in your overall health. Osteoporosis, heart disease, incontinence, and more.</p>
            <h2>How We Can Help</h2>
            <p>How do you find a way to relieve these symptoms and become the woman you used to be? Or become even better? How do you make this stage of your life and beyond a happy, joyful time?</p>
            <h3>Your Personal Health Coach</h3>
            <p>As a Functional Medicine Health Coach, I specialize in supporting women through this significant life transition. I’ll meet you where you are, help you identify your unique strengths and guide you in making sustainable lifestyle changes that align with your personal vision of optimal health during this stage of life.</p>
            <p>My training at the Functional Medicine Coaching Academy equips me with a systems-based approach, grounded in scientific evidence, to address the unique challenges of perimenopause and menopause. Together, we will leverage your strengths to cultivate a growth mindset, leading to symptom relief and inspiring personal transformation.
